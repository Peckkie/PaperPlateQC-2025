# PaperPlate-Defect-Detection

## Overview  
This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for detecting and classifying defective paper plates. The model is trained to identify non-standard plates based on shape, texture, size, and other quality indicators.

## Features  
- AI-powered detection of defective paper plates  
- Image processing and computer vision techniques  
- Deep learning model trained on a dataset of standard and defective plates  
- Real-time or batch processing capability  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV for image processing  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning  
- YOLOv8 / EfficientNet (or any model you are using)  
- Labeling tools such as LabelImg  

## Goals  
- Improve quality control in paper plate manufacturing  
- Automate the defect detection process  
- Reduce human error and increase production efficiency  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:
